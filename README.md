## Â¿What does app contain?

The app contains several graphs and insights from your income and expenses in your bank account, getting worth information from your net results (income and expenses). The app contains the following page:

- **Inicio**: The home page is used to get the inputs from the user, as the name, target saving, link token and security token. Those inputs are used to extract the information by API (security and token), and also used as a input for some graph (target).

- **Clasificador**: This page is used to clasify manually some records that can not be classify by the logic of the app. You will have a table with information from the date, description movement, type of movements, amount, etc. As those are you movement, probably you must know better what they are.

- **Home**: The first page of the data, when you can look at information from your income, expenses and net flow from your bank account. This page is a summary of what you have spend of and your incomes.

- **Objetivo (Details)**: In this page, you can review the top 5 categories that you must spend of. Also, you can review your total expenses by month, target saving value (input getting from the start page) and your desviation. 

- **Gastos (Table)**: This page is used to show your total expenses by categories for each month, showing you how much you spend in each item by month.

- **Comportamiento (Tendency)**: This page is used to show some tendency in your data. Based on your distribution daily expenses by day of the month, you can look at how much you should spend in the current month by day and month. You can look at predicted forecast of the current month expenses, based on your past distribution. 

- **Inversiones**: This page is used to show your income and expenses movement from your investment. If you do not have any investment movement in your account, you should not see any information in this page.

I also hightligh that the logic was created based on your bank account as a the center, so if you are moving money in your bank products. If you move money to your investment, that is a money outflow from your bank account, in contract, if you move money from your investment to your bank account, that is a inflow of money in your bank account.

## Transaction Classifier

The classifier was done using regex, based on the description of the transaction. Those regex are in the constants.py file into the bank folder, with the following information:
